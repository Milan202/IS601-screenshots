- generate a list of tasks where the due date is older than now and that are not complete
We use the python filter function to get task which are marked as not done
The filter function can be applied to an iterable such as a list or a dictionary and create a new iterator.
Get tasks whose due date has passed and the task is not done
- pass that list into list_tasks()
Pass the filtered out list to the list_tasks() function to display the list of tasks selected.

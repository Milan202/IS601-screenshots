A test case is an individual unit of testing which checks for a specific response given a particular set of inputs.
A unit test checks that a single component operates in the right way. 
Some of the advantages of unit testing are:
It helps you to isolate what is broken in your application and fix it faster.
It helps also ensure code stability as the code is contantly verified.
